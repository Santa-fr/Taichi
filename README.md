In this readme, I will explain how the dataset is formed.

Firstly, the raw data in csv and fbx format are stocked in the raw_csv and raw_fbx files.

All the cleaned data is stocked in the "data" file.
It's a csv with lines corresponding to the time series and the cols corresponding to each degree of freedom for each body part of the avatar.
The col_info csv give us all the information about what column is what kind of data.

[col_info.csv](https://github.com/perroquent/Taichi/files/10158137/col_info.csv)

Each data file is named this way : 
Name chen31 mouv_nbr.csv

And the caracteristics about each practicant is in the file participants_info.csv
